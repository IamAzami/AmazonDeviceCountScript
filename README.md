This excerpt highlights the primary structure of utilities() and t_count(), which handle resource tracking and display summaries based on inventory levels. 
Each type of equipment or inventory is checked against an expected value, and appropriate messages are displayed for scenarios where supplies meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. 
The utilities() function covers different resources, while t_count() focuses on tracking totes across specific areas.
